        description:
          "ECS represents the long-term change in global mean surface temperature following a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It is a key metric for understanding the sensitivity of Earth's climate system to radiative forcing and is crucial for predicting future climate change and informing policy decisions. ECS is influenced by various feedback mechanisms, including water vapor, clouds, and ice-albedo feedbacks, which can amplify or dampen the initial warming response.",
        interpretation:
          "Higher ECS values indicate a more sensitive climate system, leading to greater warming for a given increase in CO2. This has significant implications for global temperature projections, sea level rise, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Understanding ECS helps policymakers set emission reduction targets to mitigate the impacts of climate change.",

It is a key metric for understanding the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation, influencing how the climate responds to factors such as greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols. ",
        interpretation:
          "A more negative λ value indicates that the climate system has stronger stabilizing feedbacks, which help to counteract warming and maintain equilibrium. Conversely, a less negative or positive λ suggests that the climate system is more sensitive to perturbations, potentially leading to amplified warming in response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Understanding λ is essential for improving climate models and informing policy decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.",

            TCRE quantifies the change in global mean surface temperature per
            1000 GtC of cumulative CO2 emissions. It reflects the near-linear
            relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and global warming,
            highlighting the direct impact of human activities on climate
            change. TCRE is a crucial metric for setting carbon budgets and
            informing climate policy, as it helps estimate the allowable
            emissions to limit global temperature rise to specific targets, such
            as those outlined in the Paris Agreement.

            temperature following the cessation of CO2 emissions after a
            sustained period of increase. It reflects the balance between
            ongoing ocean heat uptake and the reduction in radiative forcing due
            to decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels. This metric is important for
            understanding the long-term climate implications of emission
            scenarios and for informing climate policy.
