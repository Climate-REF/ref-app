# About Climate REF

## Overview

The Climate Rapid Evaluation Framework (Climate REF) is an automated system for evaluating Earth system models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 7 (CMIP7).
This framework provides standardized diagnostics and performance metrics to facilitate timely assessment of model simulations against observational datasets.
The currently deployed version of the Climate REF uses CMIP6 datasets, but will be updated to include CMIP7 results when they are available.

## Background and Motivation

The evaluation of Earth system models has become increasingly complex as models incorporate more processes and produce larger volumes of output data.
Traditional evaluation approaches, which often rely on manual processing and analysis, can introduce significant delays between model data submission and the availability of evaluation results.
These delays can impede the iterative model development process and limit the community's ability to identify and address systematic biases across the multi-model ensemble.

Climate REF addresses these challenges through automation of the evaluation workflow, enabling systematic and reproducible assessment of model performance across a comprehensive suite of diagnostics.
This brings together 3 different model benchmarking packages into a common framework.

## Technical Capabilities

### Diagnostic Coverage

The CMIP Model Benchmarking Task Team developed an initial set of key diagnostics that the REF could target through community consulation.
The framework implements diagnostics that cover key components of the Earth system:

- **Atmosphere**: Temperature, precipitation, circulation indices, cloud properties, and radiation balance
- **Ocean**: Temperature and salinity profiles, mixed layer depth, meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice extent
- **Land**: Surface temperature, soil moisture, vegetation indices, and terrestrial carbon stocks
- **Biogeochemistry**: Carbon cycle diagnostics, primary productivity, and nutrient distributions

### Evaluation Methodology

Climate REF isn't responsible for any new diagnostics. The aim is to bring the established model benchmarking and evaluation packages into to a common framework.
The Climate REF provides a systematic way of executing these diangostics packages and interpreting their outputs.

These evaluation techniques include:

- Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias calculations against observational datasets
- Taylor diagram statistics for pattern correlation and variability assessment
- Trend analysis for historical simulations
- Process-oriented diagnostics following published methodologies
- Multi-model ensemble statistics and inter-model spread quantification

## Implementation and Design

### Interoperability

Climate REF adheres to CMIP data standards and conventions:

- Full support for CF-compliant NetCDF formats
- CMOR-compliant variable naming and metadata
- Integration with ESGF search and data access protocols
- Output compatibility with standard analysis packages

The REF will monitor ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) data nodes for new CMIP7 submissions and initiates processing automatically.

### Reproducibility

All results generated are archived for future reference.
We track the datasets that were used to generate any values.

- Transparent handling of observational uncertainties (WIP)
- Archived configuration files for result reproduction
- Provenance generation

## Project Development

Climate REF was developed through collaboration between multiple institutions involved in CMIP7 planning and implementation.
The framework design benefited from extensive community input, including feedback from modeling centers, diagnostic developers, and the CMIP Panel.
Development priorities were guided by the requirements outlined in the CMIP7 protocol and lessons learned from previous CMIP phases.

The accelerated timeline for CMIP7 necessitated rapid development while maintaining scientific rigor.
The development team implemented agile methodologies to deliver core functionality within the required timeframe, with ongoing refinements based on user feedback.

## Access and Usage

Climate REF provides multiple interfaces for accessing evaluation results:

[**Data Explorer**](/explorer/themes)
Interactive interface for querying and visualizing model evaluation results. Users can select specific models, variables, and experiments for detailed analysis.

[**Diagnostic Browser**](/diagnostics)
Pre-computed evaluation metrics organized by model component and diagnostic type. Results include statistical summaries, spatial maps, and time series comparisons.
