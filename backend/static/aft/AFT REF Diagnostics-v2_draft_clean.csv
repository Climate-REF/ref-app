The concept stems from research showing a clear linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global temperature change in climate models (Allen et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2009; Zickfeld et al. 2009). This relationship is called the Transient Climate Response to Cumulative CO2 Emissions (TCRE), which represents the amount of global warming caused by each trillion tonnes of carbon emitted.

To limit the influence of short-term variability, a 21-year centered running mean is applied to the time series. The year at which the time series exceeds warming levels or temperatures such as 1.5C is then recorded for the specific model ensemble member and future scenario.
