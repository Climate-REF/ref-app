# Diagnostic Metadata Overrides
#
# This file provides additional metadata for diagnostics that supplements or overrides
# the default values from the diagnostic implementations. It's particularly useful for:
# - Exposing which reference datasets are used by each diagnostic
# - Providing display names and descriptions
# - Adding tags for categorization
#
# Structure:
#   provider-slug/diagnostic-slug:
#     reference_datasets:
#       - slug: "dataset-slug"
#         description: "Description of how this dataset is used"
#         type: "primary|secondary|comparison"
#     display_name: "Display Name (overrides default)"
#     tags: ["category1", "category2"]
#
# Example diagnostics (uncomment and populate with real diagnostics as needed):

# pmp/annual-cycle:
#   reference_datasets:
#     - slug: "obs4mips.CERES-EBAF.v4.2"
#       description: "CERES Energy Balanced and Filled - Primary reference for TOA radiation"
#       type: "primary"
#     - slug: "obs4mips.GPCP.v2.3"
#       description: "Global Precipitation Climatology Project - Precipitation comparison"
#       type: "secondary"
#   display_name: "Annual Cycle Analysis"
#   tags: ["atmosphere", "seasonal-cycle", "radiation"]

# pmp/mean-state:
#   reference_datasets:
#     - slug: "obs4mips.ERA5.v1"
#       description: "ERA5 Reanalysis - Primary climatology reference"
#       type: "primary"
#   display_name: "Mean State Climatology"
#   tags: ["atmosphere", "climatology"]
