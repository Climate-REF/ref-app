# Climate REF Application: Scientific Content Strategy


---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Current State
The Climate REF application has established a strong foundation for scientific content through the Explorer interface, with comprehensive documentation for thematic metrics across five major themes (Atmosphere, Sea, Land, Earth System, and Impact & Adaptation). However, significant opportunities exist to extend this scientific context throughout the application.

### Strategic Vision
Transform the Climate REF application from a data presentation tool into a scientifically-rich educational platform that:
- Provides context at every decision point
- Guides users toward scientifically meaningful comparisons
- Links to authoritative references and external resources
- Maintains scientific accuracy through expert review

### Key Priorities
1. **Diagnostics Discovery** (HIGH) - Help users understand what each diagnostic measures and why it matters
2. **Figure Interpretation** (HIGH) - Provide context for understanding diagnostic outputs
3. **Dataset Context** (MEDIUM) - Explain dataset types, sources, and appropriate uses
4. **Help & Documentation** (MEDIUM) - Comprehensive user guides and scientific glossary

---

---

## 3. Additional Areas Requiring Scientific Context

### 3.1 Diagnostics Index Page

**Current State:**
Location: `frontend/src/routes/_app/diagnostics.index.tsx`

The diagnostics listing shows cards with basic metadata (provider, name, execution counts) but lacks:
- Purpose and scientific rationale for each diagnostic
- Guidance on when to use specific diagnostics
- Relationships between diagnostics
- Expected outputs and interpretation guidance

**Priority:** **HIGH**

**Rationale:** This is the primary entry point for users exploring available diagnostics. Without context, users cannot make informed choices about which analyses to review.

**Proposed Enhancements:**

1. **Diagnostic Card Content**
   - One-sentence "why this matters" statement
   - Expected output types (scalars, timeseries, maps)
   - Typical use cases
   - Related diagnostics

2. **Thematic Organization**
   - Group diagnostics by scientific domain
   - Add domain-level introductions
   - Visual indicators for diagnostic types

3. **Search and Discovery**
   - Semantic search by scientific concept
   - Filter by climate theme or variable
   - Sort by relevance to research question

**Example Enhancement:**
```typescript
{
  diagnostic: "global-mean-timeseries",
  scientificContext: {
    purpose: "Evaluates model representation of long-term climate trends",
    useCase: "Essential for assessing climate sensitivity and transient response",
    outputs: ["timeseries", "statistics"],
    relatedDiagnostics: ["climate-sensitivity", "trend-analysis"]
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Individual Diagnostic Detail Pages

**Current State:**
Location: `frontend/src/routes/_app/diagnostics.$providerSlug.$diagnosticSlug/`

Diagnostic pages show execution groups and results but lack:
- Scientific interpretation of the diagnostic methodology
- Guidance on interpreting results
- Context for typical model performance
- Links to relevant literature

**Priority:** **HIGH**

**Rationale:** Users viewing diagnostic results need to understand what they're looking at and how to interpret patterns in the data.

**Proposed Enhancements:**

1. **Diagnostic Overview Section**
   - Full description of what the diagnostic measures
   - Methodology explanation (2-4 paragraphs)
   - Key references
   - Known limitations and caveats

2. **Result Interpretation Guide**
   - What "good" performance looks like
   - Common model biases for this diagnostic
   - Interpretation of different metrics/statistics
   - Regional vs global considerations

3. **AFT Integration Enhancement**
   - Currently links to AFT diagnostic metadata
   - Expand to show full AFT description
   - Link to IPCC chapters and relevant sections
   - Connection to CMIP evaluation priorities

**Data Model Enhancement Needed:**
```python
class DiagnosticDetail(DiagnosticSummary):
    """Enhanced diagnostic with full scientific context"""
    methodology: str  # Detailed methodology explanation
    interpretation_guide: str  # How to interpret results
    typical_performance: str  # What to expect from models
    key_references: list[Reference]
    limitations: str | None
    related_ipcc_chapters: list[str] | None
```

### 3.3 Figure Galleries and Visualizations

**Current State:**
Location: `frontend/src/routes/_app/diagnostics.$providerSlug.$diagnosticSlug/figures.tsx`

Figure galleries display diagnostic outputs without:
- Captions explaining what's shown
- Interpretation guidance for patterns
- Context for color scales and units
- Links to underlying data

**Priority:** **HIGH**

**Rationale:** Figures are the primary way users evaluate model performance. Without context, visual patterns may be misinterpreted.

**Proposed Enhancements:**

1. **Figure Metadata Enhancement**
   - Standardized caption format
   - Explanation of visualization type
   - Guidance on interpretation (e.g., "Red colors indicate warm bias")
   - Note on statistical significance

2. **Interactive Elements**
   - Hover tooltips with contextual information
   - Click to expand with detailed interpretation
   - Compare with reference data explanation
   - Link to related figures

3. **Gallery Organization**
   - Group by figure type (maps, timeseries, statistics)
   - Provide section introductions
   - Highlight key findings
   - Progressive disclosure of detail

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
interface FigureContext {
  caption: string;  // What is shown
  interpretation: string;  // What it means
  colorScaleGuide?: string;  // How to read colors
  statisticalNotes?: string;  // Significance, uncertainty
  relatedFigures?: string[];  // Links to related visualizations
}
```

### 3.4 Dataset Detail Pages

**Current State:**
Location: `frontend/src/routes/_app/datasets.$slug.tsx`

Dataset pages show metadata and execution lists but lack:
- Scientific context for dataset types
- Explanation of CMIP6 metadata (experiment_id, variant_label, etc.)
- Guidance on appropriate use of different datasets
- Quality flags or known issues

**Priority:** **MEDIUM**

**Rationale:** Users need to understand dataset provenance and appropriate usage, especially for different source types (models vs observations).

**Proposed Enhancements:**

1. **Dataset Type Context**
   - Explanation of CMIP6 vs obs4MIPs vs other types
   - Description of what experiment_id means
   - Explanation of ensemble members (variant_label)
   - Temporal and spatial coverage context

2. **Quality Indicators**
   - Known issues or caveats
   - Completeness metrics
   - Comparison to other versions
   - Update frequency and status

3. **Usage Guidance**
   - Appropriate uses for this dataset type
   - Common applications in literature
   - Suggested diagnostics for evaluation
   - Related datasets for comparison

**Example Content Structure:**
```markdown
### CMIP6 Model Output: ACCESS-CM2 (historical, r1i1p1f1)

**Experiment:** Historical simulation (1850-2014) forced with observed GHG concentrations,
aerosols, and land use changes.

**Ensemble Member:** First realization (r1) with initialization 1 (i1), physics variant 1 (p1),
and forcing variant 1 (f1). This represents one possible climate state from this model
configuration.

**Typical Use:** Evaluating model performance against observations during the historical
period. Compare with obs4MIPs datasets for validation.

**Known Issues:** [Link to model documentation or known issues]
```

### 3.5 General Help and Documentation
